Hexadecimal to decimal and Hexadecimal to octal. 
The user must select numbers and after that enter the number agreeing to their change. This extend has made the number framework transformation quick and simple for the user.

Features:
1.User can get answers to any number system convertion.
2.User can get multiple number of convertion.


SWOT Analysis:
## Strenghts:
1.With number system convertion  users can convert a given number system to any other number system.
2.Users can save their time ,without finding it manually.
3.users can reduse the time and effort .

## Threats:
 1. Application may crash somtimes.
 2. Can hit error when given huge value.
 
 
 ## 4W's and 1H:
 Who: Any Users
 What: Used for convertion.
 When: Anytime when ever needed.
 How: Through e-site.
